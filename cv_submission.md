Reflection (STAR)

Situation:
The Work Readiness training required me to submit my CV and GitHub portfolio link on Blackboard by the given deadline.  

Task: 
My responsibility was to ensure that the CV (in PDF format) and GitHub portfolio link were correctly uploaded to Blackboard.  

Action:  
I prepared my CV in PDF format, verified my GitHub repository link, and submitted both via the Blackboard submission link. I captured a screenshot as proof of submission.  

Result: 
The submission was successfully completed on 07 March 2025.

The screenshot and confirmation evidence prove that I submitted my CV and portfolio as required.
