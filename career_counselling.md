Career Counselling â€” Evidence & Reflection

Evidence
Due to health reasons, I could not attend the scheduled Career Counselling session.  
Instead, I conducted independent research on career readiness and guidance through online resources .  
I also reviewed job descriptions in ICT fields (Software Developer, ICT Support Technician, Systems Analyst) to understand employer expectations.  


Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
I was supposed to attend a career counselling session as part of Work Readiness training but could not due to health challenges. Despite this, I recognized the importance of planning my career path and reflecting on my goals.  

**Task:**  
My task was to identify alternative ways to gain career guidance and ensure I still benefited from the career readiness component of the training.  

**Action:**  
I researched career advice from online professional platforms such as LinkedIn and Indeed. I also explored ICT-related job postings to understand the key skills and qualifications needed.

**Result:**  
Although I did not attend the physical session, I gained valuable insights into career planning. I now have a clearer understanding of the types of roles that align with my skills, the importance of tailoring my CV to job descriptions, and how continuous learning (certifications, coding practice) can increase my employability. This independent reflection allowed me to meet the learning outcomes despite my absence.
