Reflection (STAR)

Situation:
As part of the Work Readiness training, I was required to create a professional CV that reflects my academic journey, technical skills, and practical experience.  

Task: 
I needed to compile my educational background, certificates, skills, and work experience into a clear and professional CV that would be suitable for internship and graduate applications.  

Action:
I gathered information from my academic records and work history, drafted my CV using Microsoft Word, and formatted it into a polished design. I included key achievements like my Google IT Support Certificate, projects such as the Security Tracking Website, and professional experience from Takealot and Tradeways. I refined the CV after reviewing examples and receiving feedback.  

Result:
The final CV highlights my strengths as a motivated ICT student with technical expertise and customer service experience. It has been saved in PDF format and added to my portfolio as `artifacts/CV.pdf`. This CV is now ready to be used for professional applications and career opportunities.
